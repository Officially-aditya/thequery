# 10. COURSE RESOURCES & NEXT STEPS

(You've reached the end of the technical content. If you've built the projects, you know more about production RAG + KG systems than most engineers claiming to be "AI experts." The resources below help you go deeper. The career section shows you what's possible. But remember: the market doesn't care about courses completed - it cares about systems shipped. Build things, put them on GitHub, write about what you learned. That's how you get hired.)
